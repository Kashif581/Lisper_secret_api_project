a client-side website that uses the Secrets API in order to reveal the deepest, darkest secrets of people anonymously. This is inspired by a real app called, Whisper that was pretty famous a few years back, and essentially
it's people across the Internet sharing their secrets anonymously, and it's weirdly fascinating to read through people's secrets and what they reveal to us when they don't need to be identified.
And in order to do this, we have used the Secrets API and getting hold of random secrets using Axios.
